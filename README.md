# LUNGCANCER
In this study, we address the handling of missing data in a dataset of lung cancer patients, specifically focusing on those diagnosed with diabetes. Key biomarkers analyzed include plasma_CA19_9, LYVE1, CYFRA 21-1, and Creatinine. To manage missing values, we employed the K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN) algorithm for data imputation.
